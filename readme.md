Arduino control for Ikea Beckant sit/stand desk with 2 DC Bosch motors. 
My original electronics for this table has died. The issue with simple setup (without any electronics) is the slight difference in speed
between 2 motors. The situation gets worse with uneven load for 1 of the motors. 

The setup is the following: 
- Arduino Uno
- H-Bridge capable of running 2 24V DC motors
- Original power supply
- I2C display (mostly for debugging)
- 2 Push buttons
- 2 Hall sensors
